    <h2>HI, I'M KATIE</h2>
    <p>
      After 5 years of working in tech marketing I decided to quit my job in San Francisco and travel the world! I've been traveling for 6 months so far and have loved every second. Recently I attended the Institute of Code where I learned to code websites and brand pages. Currently I am working remotely and coding sites for clients in my free time. I'm a sucker for clean, responsive and simple websites that are easy to read and digest for the specific target audience.

      If you're interested in having me create a site for your small business, please contact me below!
